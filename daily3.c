 Purpose:	<make a smiley face using printf statements and * characters>	
Sources	of	Help:	<I didnt use any external sources>
Questions to	answer:	
(1)	How	many	printf	functions	did	you	call? 
   I called 6 printf statements for each face, 18 printf statements in total
(2)	Do	you	have	any	lines	of	code	that	are	exactly	the	same?
   Within the code for 1 smiley face, there are no lines of code that are exactly the same. Within the code for all 3 faces, there are
   lines that are the same. 
Time	Spent: ~35 minutes
